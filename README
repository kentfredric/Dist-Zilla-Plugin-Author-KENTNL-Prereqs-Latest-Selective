NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::KENTNL::Prereqs::Latest::Selective -
    [DEPRECATED] Selectively upgrade a few modules to depend on the version
    used.

VERSION
    version 0.1.3

SYNOPSIS
            [Autoprereqs]

            [Author::KENTNL::Prereqs::Latest::Selective]

    This will automatically upgrade the minimum required version to the
    currently running version, for a selective list of packages, wherever
    they appear in dependencies.

    Currently, the list of packages that will be upgraded to the current
    version are as follows:

    *   Test::More - What I test all my packages with

    *   Module::Build - The Installer I use for everything

    *   Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL - The configuration setup
        I use for everything.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is deprecated and no longer used by @Author::KENTNL

    Instead, he recommends you use "[Prereqs::MatchInstalled]"

METHODS
  wanted_latest
            my $hash = $plugin->wanted_latest();

    A "Hash" of Modules I want to be "Latest I've released with"

            {
                    'Test::More' => 1,
                    'Module::Build' => 1,
                    'Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL' => 1,
            }

  current_version_of
            my $v = $plugin->current_version_of('Foo');

    Returns the currently installed version of a given thing.

  for_each_dependency
            $plugin->for_each_dependency( $cpan_meta, sub {
                    my ( $self, $info ) = @_;

                    printf "%s => %s\n", $_ , $info->{$_} for qw( phase type package requirement )
            });

    Utility for iterating all dependency specifications.

    Each dependency spec is passed as a "HashRef"

            {
                    phase => 'configure',
                    type  => 'requires',
                    package => 'Module::Metadata',
                    requirement => bless({}, 'CPAN::Meta::Requirements::_Range::_Range'); # or close.
            }

  register_prereqs
    This module executes during "prereqs" generation.

    As such, its advised to place it after other things you want "prereq"'s
    upgraded on.

    ( Presently, it won't matter if you place it before, because it does
    some magic with phase emulation, but that might be removed one day )
