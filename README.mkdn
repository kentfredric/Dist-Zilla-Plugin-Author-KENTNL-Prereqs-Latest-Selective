# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Author::KENTNL::Prereqs::Latest::Selective - \[DEPRECATED\] Selectively upgrade a few modules to depend on the version used.

# VERSION

version 0.1.1

# SYNOPSIS

	[Autoprereqs]

	[Author::KENTNL::Prereqs::Latest::Selective]

This will automatically upgrade the minimum required version to the currently running version, for a selective  list of packages,
wherever they appear in dependencies.

Currently, the list of packages that will be upgraded to the current version are as follows:

- Test::More    - What I test all my packages with
- Module::Build - The Installer I use for everything
- Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::KENTNL - The config setup I use for everything.

# DESCRIPTION
